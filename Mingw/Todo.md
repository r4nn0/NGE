### Add soundplaying to engine using OpenAL: https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft

### Add collision boxes (Both 2D and 3D)

### Add modelMatrix for 2D objects (for easier rotaiton and scaling)

### Fix realistic graphics / lighting (With / without Vulkan)

### Add bindless textures (SSBO) (Partially done)
### Add Vulkan support since only nvidia and amd gpus support bindless textures
### Keep texture atlas as a fallback method (MaxRect packing)
### Alternativaly add TextureArrays (3D arrays with fixed size, up to 2048 layers per texture array)


### Custom font renderer (with shaders)

### Fix so that there is only one renderer for both 2D and 3D (Almost done)
