# NGE (Newbies Game Engine)
## (In development)
Indiemade C++ Engine<br/>
NGE is free open source project built for game developers using C++ <br/>
This Engine is based on OpenGL Libraries, some other libraries included i wrote them my self with the help of compiler's built-in functions to make things easier <br/>
# Supported Operating Systems
<b>[+] Windows</b><br/>
<b>[+] Linux</b><br/>
<b>[\~] Mac OS [Soon]</b><br/>

# How To Setup
Currently I'm working on the MINGW version of the engine, so only the files under the MINGW folder are up to date<br/>
You can simply compile the engine using "make"
Here are the libraries used for the compilation
<ul>
  <li><b>ftgl</b> [ftgl_static for the static of ftgl]</li>
  <li><b>freetype</b> You will need this in order to use ftgl</li>
  <li><b>glew32</b> [glew32s for the static library of glew]</li>
  <li><b>glfw3dll</b> [glfw3 for the static library of glfw3]</li>
  <li><b>gdi32</b></li>
  <li><b>winmm</b></li>
  <li><b>opengl32</b></li>
</ul><br/>
Some Macros has to be defined when linking static libraries<br/>
For example:
<h4> &#35define GLEW_STATIC</h4>

# How To Use
Check out the Docs/index.html under the MINGW folder for documentations
# Features that aren't added yet
Music and sound effects can't be imported and played yet.
# Newly Added Features
You can render your sprites by creating a texture page and adding them to it <br/>
It is now possible to render from different texture pages simultaneously <br/>
